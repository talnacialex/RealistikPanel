# RealistikPanel!
The modern admin panel for osu! private servers!

It uses libraries such as Flask for web and is designed to interface with the Ripple stack (mainly with SQL and Redis).

# About

This is an modified version of RealistikPanel! that can be used together with the osu!katakuna's kodachi score server.

You may notice that some of this code (especially the early one) is not too great. This is because this is a learning trip for me.
I am using a lot of libraries and concepts that are new to me and it's the first time I'm doing them.
This may be reflected in the quality of the code. I will try to fix up or replace some of the old code when I'm satisfied with the feature set.

This project is now ready to be deployed as a full replacement to RAP.

# Feature set
Everyday tons of new features
- Recent Plays
- Common statistics and graphs (dashboard)
